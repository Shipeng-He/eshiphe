            "Answer": "Project cost management involves the processes required to ensure that a project is completed within the approved budget. It encompasses several key activities, including:\n\n1. **Cost Estimation**: Predicting the costs needed for project resources, labor, materials, and other expenses.\n2. **Cost Budgeting**: Allocating the estimated costs to individual work items to establish a cost baseline.\n3. **Cost Control**: Monitoring the project’s actual cost performance against the cost baseline, identifying variances, and implementing corrective actions to keep the project within budget.\n\nThe goal of project cost management is to manage and control the costs to ensure that the project is completed within the approved budget while meeting the project’s objectives and deliverables."

            "QuestionContent": "Why delay critical path will result into whole project delay?",
            "Answer": "Delays in the critical path will result in the whole project being delayed because the critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks required to complete the project. This sequence determines the shortest possible duration for the entire project. If any task on the critical path is delayed, there is no slack time available to absorb the delay, and thus, the completion of the entire project is pushed back. Since the critical path is the longest path through the project network, any delay in this path directly extends the project's overall duration."

            "Answer": "The project ID in the Project decision document is 65001006. To determine if the total actual cost is within the planned cost, we need to sum the actual costs of all WBS elements associated with Project ID 65001006 and compare it to the planned cost.\n\nHere are the actual costs for each WBS element of Project ID 65001006:\n\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.01: 310100 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.02: 236320 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.03: 424190 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.04: 100000 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.05: 383630 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.06: 280866 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.07: 868250 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.08: 380000 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.09: 115440 CNY\n- XYZ19.M01006.XX.10: 420000 CNY\n\nTotal actual cost = 310100 + 236320 + 424190 + 100000 + 383630 + 280866 + 868250 + 380000 + 115440 + 420000 = 3510796 CNY\n\nThe planned cost for the project, according to the total project summary, is 3,500,000 CNY.\n\nComparing the two values:\n- Total actual cost: 3,510,796 CNY\n- Planned cost: 3,500,000 CNY\n\nThe total actual cost (3,510,796 CNY) exceeds the planned cost (3,500,000 CNY) by 10,796 CNY. Therefore, the total actual cost is not within the planned cost for the project."
